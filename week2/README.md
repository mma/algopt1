**Dequeue.** A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced “deck”) is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure. Implemented using single linked list.

**Randomized queue.** A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random from items in the data structure. Implemented using resizing array.

97% passing grade (a few memory and timing tests fail 😞 )
